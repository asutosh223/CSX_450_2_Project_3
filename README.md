# Project - Boston Housing Data

## Domain
This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. Concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston.

## Problem Statement

First explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, you will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. You will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable you to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, you will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.
